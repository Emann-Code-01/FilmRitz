# FilmRitz User Interview Script: Decision Intelligence

## Goal

To understand precisely where users experience "decision fatigue" when choosing what to watch and identify which "trust signals" are most effective at reducing that fatigue.

---

## 1. Discovery Habits (Background)

- "How do you usually decide what to watch on a typical weekday evening?"
- "What apps or websites do you use to research a film before committing?"
- "How long does it usually take from 'I want to watch something' to 'Pressing play'?"

## 2. Decision Friction (Pain Points)

- "Have you ever spent 20+ minutes looking for something and then given up? Tell me about the last time that happened."
- "When you see a rating (like 7.2), how much do you trust it? What makes you doubt a rating?"
- "What information is usually _missing_ when you're looking at a movie's page?"

## 3. Intelligence Features (Testing the Hypothesis)

- _Show the Trust-Weighted Rating component:_
  - "What does 'High Confidence' vs 'Low Confidence' mean to you in this context?"
  - "Does seeing the number of reviews (e.g., 145k) next to the rating change how much you trust it?"
- _Show Tone & Mood Chips:_
  - "Instead of just 'Drama', how helpful is it to see labels like 'Atmospheric', 'Slow-burn', or 'Witty'?"
- _Show Commitment Indicators:_
  - "How often does the length of a movie (runtime) or the number of seasons influence your decision?"

## 4. Closing

- "If an app could tell you _exactly why_ you would like a movie in one sentence, what would you want that sentence to focus on? (The plot, the director, the vibe, or the similarity to another film?)"

## Observations to Track

- [ ] Time spent on discovery vs. research.
- [ ] Relative importance of Rating vs. Runtime vs. Genre.
- [ ] Reaction to "Trust Scores" (Do they feel superior to raw averages?).
